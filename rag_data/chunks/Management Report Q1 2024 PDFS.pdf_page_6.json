Non -\nGAAP gross profit  and margin exclude stock -based compensation expense and the amortization of acquired \ntechnology  under costs of revenues . Non -GAAP net income excludes stock -based compensation expense, \namortization of acquired technology  under costs of revenues,  amortization of other acquired intangible assets \nand the effects of certain non -recurring items, such as expenses related to an arbitration proceeding for a \ndisputed contract with a customer, acquisition -related costs, proceeds from the sale of previously written -off \nproperty a nd equipment, and their related income tax effects, as applicable, as well as adjustments for the \nvaluation allowance for deferred tax assets  and reconciling items . These non -GAAP financial measures are used \nby management internally t o measure the Company’s profitability and performance. PDF Solutions’ management \nbelieves that these non -GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information  to investors regarding the \nCompany’s ongoing operations in light of the fact that none of these categories of expense has a current effect \non the future uses of cash (with the exception of expenses related to an arbitration proceeding for a disp uted \ncontract  with a customer and acquisition -related costs ) nor do they impact the generation of current or  future \nrevenues. These non -GAAP results should not be considered an alternative to, or a substitute for, GAAP financial \ninformation, and may differ from similarly titled non -GAAP measures used by other companies. In particular, \nthese non -GAAP financial me asures are not a substitute for GAAP measures of income or loss as a measure of \nperformance, or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Since \nmanagement uses these non -GAAP financial measures internally t o measure profitability and performance; PDF \nSolutions  has included these non-GAAP measures to give investors an opportunity to see the Company ’s financial \nresults as viewed by management. A reconciliation of the comparable GAAP financial measures to the non -GAAP \nfinancial measures is included herein.  \n \n  ", "metadata": {"page": 6, "doc_id": "Management Report Q1 2024 PDFS.pdf", "source": "C:\\Users\\DELL\\Documents\\Projet_NLP\\uploads\\Management Report Q1 2024 PDFS.pdf", "type": "pdf"}}
