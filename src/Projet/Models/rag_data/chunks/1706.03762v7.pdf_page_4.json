The input consists of\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\nvalues.\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\nthe matrix of outputs as:\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\n√dk)V (1)\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\nmatrix multiplication code.\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1. Then their dot product, q·k=Pdk\ni=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk.\n4", "metadata": {"page": 4, "doc_id": "1706.03762v7.pdf", "source": "C:\\Users\\DELL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpsp66mkgs\\1706.03762v7.pdf", "type": "pdf"}}
