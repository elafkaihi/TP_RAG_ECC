For the three months ended September 30, 2023 , and June 30, 2023 , the charges were related to the \nacquisition of Lantern Machinery Analytics, Inc.  \n(3) The difference between the GAAP and non -GAAP income tax provisions is primarily due to the valuation allowance on a GAAP basis and non -\nGAAP adjustments. For example, on a GAAP basis, the Company does not receive a deferred tax benefit for foreign tax credi ts or research and \ndevelopment credits after the valuation allowance. The Company’s non -GAAP tax rate and resulting non -GAAP tax expense is not calculated \nwith a full U.S. federal or state valuation allowance due to the Company’s cumulative non -GAAP income  and management’s conclusion that it \nis more likely than not to utilize its net deferred tax assets (DTAs). Each reporting period, management evaluates the need f or a valuation \nallowance and may place a valuation allowance against its U.S. net DTAs on a no n-GAAP basis if it concludes it is more likely than not that it \nwill not be able to utilize some or all of its U .S. DTAs on a non -GAAP basis.  \n \n  ", "metadata": {"page": 7, "doc_id": "Management Report Q1 2024 PDFS.pdf", "source": "C:\\Users\\DELL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpi1hz_i5s\\Management Report Q1 2024 PDFS.pdf", "type": "pdf"}}
