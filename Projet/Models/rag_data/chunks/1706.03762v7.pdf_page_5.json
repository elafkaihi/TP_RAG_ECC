These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\ndepicted in Figure 2.\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\nMultiHead( Q, K, V ) = Concat(head 1, ...,head h)WO\nwhere head i= Attention( QWQ\ni, KWK\ni, V WV\ni)\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices WQ\ni∈Rdmodel×dk,WK\ni∈Rdmodel×dk,WV\ni∈Rdmodel×dv\nandWO∈Rhdv×dmodel.\nIn this work we employ h= 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n[38, 2, 9].\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\nencoder.\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\ndff= 2048 .\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\n5", "metadata": {"page": 5, "doc_id": "1706.03762v7.pdf", "source": "C:\\Users\\DELL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpsp66mkgs\\1706.03762v7.pdf", "type": "pdf"}}
