{"text": "[Page 3]\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\nrespectively.\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n3.2 Attention\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n3", "metadata": {"page": 3, "doc_id": "1706.03762v7.pdf", "source": "C:\\Users\\DELL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpsp66mkgs\\1706.03762v7.pdf", "type": "pdf"}}
